I am a MSc student in satellite technology and I have finished master degree at [**IUST**][https://www.iust.ac.ir/en]. I was looking for an opportunity to learn AI and use it in real life applications due to my great interest in AI. Finally, I was able to pursue this field more seriously in my masterâ€™s degree, I am currently a python Developer and work on Computer Vision projects using Deep Learning. My research focuses on object recognition especially analysis, implementation and development of single-stage object detectors for high-resolution satellite images with arbitrary orientations, large aspect ratios and dense arrangement
